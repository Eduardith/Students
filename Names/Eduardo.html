wifi

As you can connect to the internet without the hassle of a wire,anywhere, anyplace.
And it also led to the ability to connect portable devices to the internet. You can connect almost as many devices as you want to one network at the same time. 
The only downside of this is that wifi has reduced speed compared to ethernet (wired) internet connection.
